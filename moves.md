# Moves of podcasting

## Homecoming

### Structure

Homecoming has a group of characters that they focus on. The drama that happens in the podcast is what one might expect to see in a tv show. With each episode, you slowly learn more about the characters with each episode. However, the information you gain from each episode isn't really enough to truly understand the characters and their motivations.

Homecoming used a lot of great sound effects. There were car horns, train whistles, dishes clinking, background conversations, water bubbling, and more. The sounds made the drama real. It sounded like something one would hear in real life, and not just a bunch of people in a recording studio.

There was a certain sound used to show that the conversation had changed to a different time, space, and character. The sound got louder and then was quickly cut off. Then a few seconds later we'd be listening to another conversation about another topic. This was helpful because without the sound it'd be difficult to follow along with the action.


### Organization

It was a bit confusing listening to Homecoming at first because each episode starts out in the middle of a conversation. It makes it difficult to follow along when you don't really know what's happening. But, it also made me want to keep listening because I wanted to figure out what was going on and fill in the gaps. After a little bit of each conversation, it switches to another conversation, one that takes place during a different time.

Even though the dialogue switched from present day to the past, it seemed like the events happening in the present continued from episode to episode. The timeline was similar. The flashbacks however were a little bit more confusing, because while I would assume they went in a certain timeline, it was hard to figure out just how much time occurred between each scene. But we only get bits of information here and there, which shows that you have to keep listening to really fill in the blanks.



## LifeAfter

### Structure

LifeAfter focuses on one man, Ross. He's the main character and though there are other characters he interacts with, we mainly hear what he's listening to (recordings of his dead wife) and his thoughts. He "talks" to the listeners. We hear a commercial for Voice Tree, which is the social networking site where he listens to his wife's posts, in every episode. Aside from the commercial, the story just follows Ross' everyday life. There's a lot of background sounds, things that one would hear walking through a city or being in an office or even just walking around one's home. Like Homecoming, the sounds make it seem realistic. There's also a sort of theme song track that plays at the beginning and end of each episode. But there's also suspenseful music that gives listeners hints about what is good and bad and what to more deeply about.

### Organization

The story is told in chronological order. There's no jump in time or place, it simply follows Ross throughout the day. Even when time passes, usually Ross says something like "when I got home after work", so we know we didn't miss anything important. The only things that are really out of order are the Voice Tree posts that Charlie, Ross' wife, posted. We hear bits a pieces of them, but we don't know what order they were posted in. But even when he listens to them, the things that happen while he's listening always go in order. While we know what's happening in Ross' life now, the Voice Tree posts give us more information. But, they don't exactly fill anything in, since there isn't really anything mysterious about the story at first. But they do make you curious and as you watch more episodes, the posts start to make a little more sense.
